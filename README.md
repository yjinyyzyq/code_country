# code_country    

My python code_country.

Python is a very grace and popular program language. 

Study is easy but study well is not easy. I work it 2 years and I really like python.

I work with python and I play with python. I write many code but I forget to push it to github.

Now, I decide to push github the code after I finished. and I hope you can get some good idea from it and you also can

give me some good advice to make the code_country strong.
